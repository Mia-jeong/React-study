1. using memoization
if you use memoization you can only fetch unique user one time, so if you want to update user data you can't do it just using this memoization

What's wrong with 'fetchPosts'>

1. Action creators must return plain JS objects with a type property. we are not
2. By the time our action gets to a reducer , we won't have fetched our data!

TIME
|    Action creator called                  Request made to typicode API
|    Action returned
|    Action sent to all reducers
|    Reducers run
|    X Data Not here! X

|
|                                                  We get response!


   it's much faster than request data to ouside of API

Redux cycle
ActionCreator > Action > dispatch > 'Middleware' > reducers > State

Middle ware in Redux

1.Function that gets called with every action we dipatch
2.Has the ability to STOP, MODIFY or otherwise mess around with actions
3.Tons of open source middleware exist
4.Most popular use of middleware is for dealing with async actions
5.We are going to use a middleware called 'Redux-Thunk' to solve our async issues


normal rules
1.AcionCreators must return action objects
2. Actions must have a type property
3. Actions can optionally have a 'payload'


Rules with Rdux Thunk
1. Aciton Creators can return action Objects Or Action Creators can return functions
2. if an action object gets returned it must have a type
3. If an action object gets returned it can optionally have a 'payload'
